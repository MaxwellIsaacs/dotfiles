<br/>
In a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr/newsroom/2024/10/apple-vision-pro-arrives-in-south-korea-beginning-friday-november-15/\">press release</a>, Apple said the Vision Pro will be available to pre-order in South Korea starting Monday, November 4 at 10 a.m. local time. In the United Arab Emirates, pre-orders begin on the same day at 5 a.m. local time, according to Apple's website.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple now has localized Vision Pro and visionOS 2 pages in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr/apple-vision-pro/\">South Korea</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ae/apple-vision-pro/\">United Arab Emirates</a> with more details. In South Korea, Apple said customers will be able to schedule a 30-minute Vision Pro demo at an Apple Store in the country. Apple said it plans to share more details about this experience after pre-orders begin. 
<br/>

<br/>
Apple first released the Vision Pro in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/\">in February</a>, with pricing starting at &#36;3,499. In June and July, the headset launched in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K., China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. With the additions of South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, the headset will be available in 12 countries and regions.
<br/>

<br/>
In July, research firm IDC estimated that Vision Pro sales would total <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/\">less than 500,000 units this year</a>. In a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/tim-cook-admits-truth-about-vision-pro/\">recent interview</a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that the Vision Pro is not a mass-market product due to its high price.
<br/>

<br/>
\"At &#36;3,500, it's not a mass-market product,\" said Cook. \"Right now, it's an early-adopter product. People who want to have tomorrow's technology todayâ€”that's who it's for.

One upgrade we thought we might see was support for the latest Wi-Fi specification, but the new machines did not get a Wi-Fi 7 upgrade.
<br/>

<br/>
<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pro-Thumb-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-974143\" />
<br/>
All of the new M4 Macs continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E, and while it does allow for access to the 6GHz band on supported Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers, it's not the latest and greatest technology.
<br/>

<br/>
It is surprising that Apple opted out of updating the new machines with Wi-Fi 7 because all of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models that came out in September feature Wi-Fi 7 chips from Broadcom. The iPhones support the 802.11be Wi-Fi 7 standard with 2x2 MIMO, but there is a caveat with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models that takes a little bit of the sting away from not getting Wi-Fi 7 in Macs.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-specifications-for-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web\">Wi-Fi specifications page</a> confirms that the Wi-Fi 7 chips in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models have a maximum physical layer data rate of 2400Mb/s and a maximum channel bandwidth of 160MHz, which is the same performance as the Wi-Fi 6E chips in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro models and the M3 Mac models with Wi-Fi 6E on 6GHz networks (Apple's chart hasn't been updated for M4, but presumably the Wi-Fi 6E chips have not changed).
<br/>

<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models does up the maximum data rate when connected to 5GHz bands compared to the Wi-Fi 6E chips used in Macs and iPads, but Apple does not support the full 320MHz bandwidth with its Wi-Fi 7 implementation. Wi-Fi 7 offers up to 320MHz bandwidth to accommodate more devices, but Apple has limited bandwidth to 160MHz, so &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models don't take full advantage of Wi-Fi 7 despite having a Wi-Fi 7 chip. That limitation has been a disappointment, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models do support Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for connecting to multiple bands at the same time for faster data transmission and lower latency on supported networks.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple certainly could have opted for a Wi-Fi 7 chip without limitations in the M4 Mac models, especially for the more expensive M4 Pro and M4 Max machines, but that didn't happen. Given that people often keep Macs for several years, it is curious that Apple opted not to offer this bit of future proofing in the Mac line. MLO would have been nice to have for gaming applications, streaming, and video conferencing, especially as people upgrade their networks in the coming years.
<br/>

<br/>
Customers who plan on purchasing one of the new M4 Macs should know that these machines continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E features and lack the faster speeds and the latency benefits that come with Wi-Fi 7.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-6e/\">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/\">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" & 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/\">Unlike iPhone 16 Models, Apple&#039;s M4 Macs Lack Wi-Fi 7 Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unlike-iphone-16-models-apples-m4-macs-lack-wi-fi-7-support.2441519/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>")) (item nil (title nil "Here's a Real-World Look at the Dramatically Smaller Mac Mini and More") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-mini-hands-on-photos/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-a-real-world-look-at-the-dramatically-smaller-mac-mini-and-more.2441505/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 13:05:08 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

<br/>
Apple says the new camera provides \"enhanced video quality in challenging lighting conditions.\"
<br/>

<br/>
Center Stage is a feature that automatically keeps you centered in the camera's view as you move around, while Desk View can show others on a video call both a view of your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.
<br/>

<br/>
Center Stage is available in video calling apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The feature was previously limited to newer iPad models and Macs connected to Apple's external Studio Display. The new MacBook Pro and iMac models are the first Macs to support Center Stage without needing to rely on a Studio Display.

Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/\">tech specs page</a> says all of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models have a peak display brightness of 1,000 nits for standard content in bright outdoor lighting, such as on a sunny day. The previous-generation MacBook Pro models have a peak display brightness of 600 nits for standard content, in any lighting conditions.
<br/>

<br/>
Keep in mind that apps like Vivid allow you to unlock full-screen HDR brightness levels of up to 1,000 nits at any time on MacBook Pro models with the Liquid Retina XDR display, but this will obviously drain your battery faster.
<br/>

<br/>
Just like all iPhone 16 models and select Apple Watch models, Apple's website says the latest MacBook Pro displays can dim to one nit in \"low-light situations.\" The minimum brightness for previous-generation MacBook Pro models was two nits.
<br/>

<br/>
Display brightness specifications for HDR content have not changed on the latest MacBook Pro models compared to the previous models.

<br/>
Apple today released &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 (build number 24B2083) for the new M4 Mac models, which are shipping with a special version of &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.0 (build number 24A8332).
<br/>

<br/>
Out of the box, the M4 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; will not support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, so to get &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, customers will need to install &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1.

<br/>
Until now, the iMac, Mac mini, 14-inch MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air all started with 8GB of RAM, leading to criticism from some Apple customers in recent years.
<br/>

<br/>
Last year, an Apple marketing employee attempted to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/\">argue that 8GB of RAM in a Mac was probably analogous to 16GB of RAM in Windows PCs</a>, given how efficient the unified memory is in M-series chips. Whether you believed that or not, you can rest assured that any new Mac sold by Apple today actually comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM.
<br/>

<br/>
The latest Mac Studio and Mac Pro already started with 32GB and 64GB of RAM, respectively.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/entire-mac-lineup-now-at-least-16gb-ram/\">Entire Mac Lineup Now Starts With at Least 16GB RAM, Ending 8GB Era</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/entire-mac-lineup-now-starts-with-at-least-16gb-ram-ending-8gb-era.2441465/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>")) (item nil (title nil "Apple Announcements Recap: M4 iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announcements-m4-imac-mac-mini-macbook-pro/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announcements-recap-m4-imac-mac-mini-and-macbook-pro.2441462/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 09:24:04 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

<br/>
Below, we've compiled a recap of all the highlights.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New iMac</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Monday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">announced</a> its latest 24-inch iMac, bringing the M4 chip to the all-in-one desktop computer. The iMac with M4 delivers up to 1.7x faster performance for daily productivity tasks and 2.1x faster speeds for demanding workflows like photo editing and gaming, according to Apple. 
<br/>

<br/>
<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-hero-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-973309\" />
<br/>
The base model now includes 16GB of RAM, double the amount of the previous entry-level configuration, with an option for up to 32GB. For the M4 iMac models with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, all four of the USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4 transfer speeds of up to 40Gb/s. The prior-generation M3 iMac with four ports had two Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB-3 ports. The 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU models only have two ports, but both of those are Thunderbolt 4. All of the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports also support USB 4 and USB 3.1 Gen 2.
<br/>

<br/>
Key features of the new iMac include:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
    <li>New 12MP front camera with Center Stage and Desk View support.</li>
<br/>
    <li>New color options including green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Optional nano-texture display for further reduced glare (+&#36;200).</li>
<br/>
    <li>Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on higher-end models (up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports).</li>
<br/>
    <li>Support for up to an 8K external display at 60Hz with M4 chip with 10-core CPU/GPU.</li>
<br/>
</ul>The updated iMac is available to order now. Pricing starts at &#36;1,299 for the 8-core CPU/GPU version, while the 10-core CPU/GPU models with four ports are priced starting at &#36;1,499. The first orders will arrive to customers and in-store availability will begin on Friday, November 8.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New Mac mini</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Tuesday introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">completely redesigned Mac mini models</a> featuring the company's latest M4 and M4 Pro chips. The new Mac mini boasts a dramatically smaller footprint, enhanced connectivity, and significant performance gains over the previous generation.

<br/>
The new machine's enclosure measures just five inches square, thanks to a new thermal architecture that guides air through the device's foot to efficiently cool the system. As part of the redesign, Apple has relocated the power button to the bottom of the enclosure. 
<br/>

<br/>
Here are the standout features of the redesigned Mac mini:
<br/>

<br/>
    <li>Up to 64GB memory on M4 Pro model, with 16GB now standard on base M4 model.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Two USB-C ports on the front and three Thunderbolt 5 ports on the back (M4 Pro model). The M4 model continues to have Thunderbolt 4 ports.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Up to 2x faster GPU performance than M1 model with M4 Pro.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Apple's first carbon-neutral Mac.</li>
<br/>
</ul>The base model with M4 chip starts at just &#36;599, making it Apple's most affordable Mac. Pre-orders for the new Mac mini are open now, with availability beginning Friday, November 8.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New MacBook Pro</h2>

<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, and is up to 1.8x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 for tasks like editing gigapixel photos, while more demanding workloads like rendering complex scenes in Blender are up to 3.4x faster, according to Apple.

First introduced with the Pro Display XDR in 2019, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote>The new MacBook Pro introduces an all-new nano-texture display option that dramatically reduces glare and distractions from reflections. In bright lighting conditions, the new MacBook Pro can now show SDR content at up to 1,000 nits and still displays HDR content at up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness. All together, itâ€™s a game-changing experience for users working outdoors.</blockquote>
<br/>

<br/>
Earlier this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/nano-texture-display-returns-to-imac/\">reintroduced</a> the nano-texture display option to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>'s nano-texture glass is a build-to-order option that costs &#36;150, configurable at the point of purchase. It is now available across the Pro Display XDR, Studio Display, &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>.

<br/>
This change applies to the 13-inch model with the M2 chip, the 13-inch model with the M3 chip, and the 15-inch model with the M3 chip.
<br/>

<br/>
In the U.S., the MacBook Air lineup continues to start at &#36;999, so there is no price increase associated with the boost in RAM.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple:<blockquote>MacBook Air is the world's most popular laptop, and with Apple Intelligence, it's even better. Now, models with M2 and M3 double the starting memory to 16GB, while keeping the starting price at just &#36;999 â€” a terrific value for the world's best-selling laptop.</blockquote>In addition, the highest-end MacBook Air configurations now include 24GB of RAM at no extra cost, as part of a corresponding lineup adjustment.
<br/>

<br/>
This increase comes after Apple announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">new iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip/\">base 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> models this week with a minimum of 16GB of RAM as well, ending the 8GB of RAM era for the Mac after years of criticism from a vocal contingent.
<br/>

<br/>
No other changes beyond RAM were announced for the MacBook Air today.
<br/>

<br/>
The latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip were released in March, and new models with the M4 chip are expected in March again next year.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/\">Apple Announces MacBook Air Now Starts With Increased 16GB of RAM With No Price Increase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-macbook-air-now-starts-with-increased-16gb-of-ram-with-no-price-increase.2441450/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>")) (item nil (title nil "Apple Announces M4 Max Chip: Up to 16-Core CPU, Up to 40-Core GPU, Up to 128GB of RAM, and More") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-m4-max-chip/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-m4-max-chip-up-to-16-core-cpu-up-to-40-core-gpu-up-to-128gb-of-ram-and-more.2441449/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 08:03:19 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Like the M4 chip introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and the M4 Pro chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">unveiled yesterday</a> in the redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, the M4 Max chips are fabricated with TSMC's enhanced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> (N3E) process. Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said:<blockquote>Apple silicon has taken the Mac to unprecedented heights, and the rapid pace of innovation continues with M4 Pro and M4 Max. With the world's fastest CPU core, immensely more powerful GPUs, and the fastest Neural Engine ever, the power-efficient performance and capabilities of the M4 family extend its lead as the most advanced lineup of chips in the industry.</blockquote>The M4 Max's 16-core CPU contains 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores, making it 2.2x faster than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a>. The GPU contains up to 40 cores for performance up to 1.9x faster than the &zwnj;M1 Max&zwnj;. The M4 Max supports up to 128GB of unified memory with up to 546GB/s of memory bandwidth.

The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro can now be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. And the base model's display brightness has also increased from 600 nits to 1,000 nits for standard non-HDR content in outdoor environments, according to Apple's tech specs.
<br/>

<br/>
The base model also gets an upgraded 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage support to keep you centered in the frame, and a Desk View feature can show others your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple says the MacBook Pro now offers up to 24 hours of battery life for \"video streaming,\" the \"longest ever in a Mac.\"

Apple has made the darker Space Black finish available for the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro this year, alongside Silver. Space Black was previously exclusive to 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models configured with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips.
<br/>

<br/>
The base model 14-inch MacBook Pro has no major external design changes, and some specs are the same as the previous model, such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. In addition to three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port and an SD card slot remain.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple says the new MacBook Pro models are available to pre-order starting today, and they will launch in many countries on Friday, November 8. In the U.S., the base 14-inch MacBook Pro continues to start at &#36;1,599.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" & 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip/\">Apple Updates Base 14-Inch MacBook Pro With M4 Chip, 16GB of RAM, Extra Thunderbolt Port, Space Black, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-base-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip-16gb-of-ram-extra-thunderbolt-port-space-black-and-more.2441446/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>")) (item nil (title nil "Proton VPN Launches Native Apple TV App, Adds Vision Pro Support") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/protonvpn-apple-tv-app/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proton-vpn-launches-native-apple-tv-app-adds-vision-pro-support.2441444/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:59:18 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

<br/>
The new tvOS app enables users to connect to ProtonVPN's network of over 8,500 servers across 112 countries, providing access to geo-restricted content while maintaining privacy from internet service providers. The interface has been specifically designed for television screens, according to the company, and features larger icons and remote control optimization for comfortable viewing on a television.
<br/>

<br/>
David Peterson, general manager of ProtonVPN, noted that the Apple TV app was \"one of the most expected and requested features\" from their community. The service promises 4K streaming capabilities without buffering or throttling.
<br/>

<br/>
The app is available to subscribers with paid plans, including Proton VPN Plus, Proton Unlimited, and Proton Visionary. Users can download the app directly from the App Store on their Apple TV. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/proton/\">Proton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/protonvpn-apple-tv-app/\">Proton VPN Launches Native Apple TV App, Adds Vision Pro Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proton-vpn-launches-native-apple-tv-app-adds-vision-pro-support.2441444/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>")) (item nil (title nil "Mac Mini vs. Mac Studio Buyer's Guide: 25+ Differences Compared") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2337590/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:12:00 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

<br/>
There are now two desktop Macs and four Apple silicon chip options for users who do not need the expandability of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,999, overshadowing the &#36;599 starting price of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a> and even the &#36;1,399 starting price of the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, so do you need the performance of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, or is the humble &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; sufficient for your needs? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two desktop Macs is best for you.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; share some fundamental features, including a familiar, boxy silver aluminum design, two front-facing USB-C ports along with HDMI and ethernet on the rear, and Apple silicon chipsets. That being said, the two machines have much more in contrast than they do in common, including different chip options, memory capacities, ports, and external display support capabilities.

Following the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;'s redesign this year, the dimensions of the two devices are now radically different, with the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; dwarfing the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; in every way.

To some extent, purchasing decisions should be driven by budget, but it is worth bearing in mind that any savings on the desktop computer itself can be put toward a good external display such as Apple's Studio Display, which starts from &#36;1,599. For example, an M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; paired with a Studio Display comes to &#36;2,898, which is just &#36;899 more than a lone base model &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &#36;1,101 less than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with no display.
<br/>

<br/>
You should only consider the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; if you have a professional workflow that can leverage the extreme power of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra, as well as its additional ports and memory options. If you need the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, you will likely know that you are looking for a highly powerful machine that is capable of supporting specific intense workflows. Most customers should choose the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, saving &#36;700 when looking at the base models. There will likely still be substantial savings when it comes to custom configurations.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is also a better choice for most users at the current time since its chip technology is two generations ahead of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, offering higher clock speeds, much faster single-core performance, a redesigned GPU architecture, AV1 decode, a markedly more powerful Neural Engine, and more. As a result, those looking to buy an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; may be better served by the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;. Those who can take advantage of the performance of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; may still be better off with that high-end machine.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/\">M4 Macs</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio/\">Mac Mini vs. Mac Studio Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2337590/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>")) (item nil (title nil "Apple Expected to Unveil New MacBook Pros Today With These Features") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/what-to-expect-from-m4-macbook-pros/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-unveil-new-macbook-pros-today-with-these-features.2441432/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 06:45:00 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

<br/>
In a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr/newsroom/2024/10/apple-vision-pro-arrives-in-south-korea-beginning-friday-november-15/\">press release</a>, Apple said the Vision Pro will be available to pre-order in South Korea starting Monday, November 4 at 10 a.m. local time. In the United Arab Emirates, pre-orders begin on the same day at 5 a.m. local time, according to Apple's website.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple now has localized Vision Pro and visionOS 2 pages in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr/apple-vision-pro/\">South Korea</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ae/apple-vision-pro/\">United Arab Emirates</a> with more details. In South Korea, Apple said customers will be able to schedule a 30-minute Vision Pro demo at an Apple Store in the country. Apple said it plans to share more details about this experience after pre-orders begin. 
<br/>

<br/>
Apple first released the Vision Pro in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/\">in February</a>, with pricing starting at $3,499. In June and July, the headset launched in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K., China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. With the additions of South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, the headset will be available in 12 countries and regions.
<br/>

In July, research firm IDC estimated that Vision Pro sales would total <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/\">less than 500,000 units this year</a>. In a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/tim-cook-admits-truth-about-vision-pro/\">recent interview</a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that the Vision Pro is not a mass-market product due to its high price.

One upgrade we thought we might see was support for the latest Wi-Fi specification, but the new machines did not get a Wi-Fi 7 upgrade.
<br/>

<br/>
<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pro-Thumb-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-974143\" />
<br/>
All of the new M4 Macs continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E, and while it does allow for access to the 6GHz band on supported Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers, it's not the latest and greatest technology.
<br/>

<br/>
It is surprising that Apple opted out of updating the new machines with Wi-Fi 7 because all of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models that came out in September feature Wi-Fi 7 chips from Broadcom. The iPhones support the 802.11be Wi-Fi 7 standard with 2x2 MIMO, but there is a caveat with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models that takes a little bit of the sting away from not getting Wi-Fi 7 in Macs.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-specifications-for-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web\">Wi-Fi specifications page</a> confirms that the Wi-Fi 7 chips in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models have a maximum physical layer data rate of 2400Mb/s and a maximum channel bandwidth of 160MHz, which is the same performance as the Wi-Fi 6E chips in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro models and the M3 Mac models with Wi-Fi 6E on 6GHz networks (Apple's chart hasn't been updated for M4, but presumably the Wi-Fi 6E chips have not changed).
<br/>

<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models does up the maximum data rate when connected to 5GHz bands compared to the Wi-Fi 6E chips used in Macs and iPads, but Apple does not support the full 320MHz bandwidth with its Wi-Fi 7 implementation. Wi-Fi 7 offers up to 320MHz bandwidth to accommodate more devices, but Apple has limited bandwidth to 160MHz, so &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models don't take full advantage of Wi-Fi 7 despite having a Wi-Fi 7 chip. That limitation has been a disappointment, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models do support Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for connecting to multiple bands at the same time for faster data transmission and lower latency on supported networks.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple certainly could have opted for a Wi-Fi 7 chip without limitations in the M4 Mac models, especially for the more expensive M4 Pro and M4 Max machines, but that didn't happen. Given that people often keep Macs for several years, it is curious that Apple opted not to offer this bit of future proofing in the Mac line. MLO would have been nice to have for gaming applications, streaming, and video conferencing, especially as people upgrade their networks in the coming years.
<br/>

<br/>
Customers who plan on purchasing one of the new M4 Macs should know that these machines continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E features and lack the faster speeds and the latency benefits that come with Wi-Fi 7.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-6e/\">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/\">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" & 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/\">Unlike iPhone 16 Models, Apple's M4 Macs Lack Wi-Fi 7 Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unlike-iphone-16-models-apples-m4-macs-lack-wi-fi-7-support.2441519/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>" "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/" (26402 20157) old 2 nil nil ((title nil "Unlike iPhone 16 Models, Apple's M4 Macs Lack Wi-Fi 7 Support") (link nil "https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/") (comments nil "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unlike-iphone-16-models-apples-m4-macs-lack-wi-fi-7-support.2441519/") (pubDate nil "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 15:20:29 PDT") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Wi-Fi 7 in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models does up the maximum data rate when connected to 5GHz bands compared to the Wi-Fi 6E chips used in Macs and iPads, but Apple does not support the full 320MHz bandwidth with its Wi-Fi 7 implementation. Wi-Fi 7 offers up to 320MHz bandwidth to accommodate more devices, but Apple has limited bandwidth to 160MHz, so &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models don't take full advantage of Wi-Fi 7 despite having a Wi-Fi 7 chip. That limitation has been a disappointment, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models do support Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for connecting to multiple bands at the same time for faster data transmission and lower latency on supported networks.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple certainly could have opted for a Wi-Fi 7 chip without limitations in the M4 Mac models, especially for the more expensive M4 Pro and M4 Max machines, but that didn't happen. Given that people often keep Macs for several years, it is curious that Apple opted not to offer this bit of future proofing in the Mac line. MLO would have been nice to have for gaming applications, streaming, and video conferencing, especially as people upgrade their networks in the coming years.
<br/>

<br/>
Customers who plan on purchasing one of the new M4 Macs should know that these machines continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E features and lack the faster speeds and the latency benefits that come with Wi-Fi 7.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-6e/\">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/\">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" & 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/\">Unlike iPhone 16 Models, Apple&#039;s M4 Macs Lack Wi-Fi 7 Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unlike-iphone-16-models-apples-m4-macs-lack-wi-fi-7-support.2441519/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"))) ("Here's a Real-World Look at the Dramatically Smaller Mac Mini and More" "After <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announcements-m4-imac-mac-mini-macbook-pro/\">announcing new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models</a> this week, Apple invited selected journalists and content creators to check out the products in person.

<br/>
Below, we've compiled a recap of all the highlights.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New iMac</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Monday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">announced</a> its latest 24-inch iMac, bringing the M4 chip to the all-in-one desktop computer. The iMac with M4 delivers up to 1.7x faster performance for daily productivity tasks and 2.1x faster speeds for demanding workflows like photo editing and gaming, according to Apple. 
<br/>

<br/>
<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-hero-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-973309\" />
<br/>
The base model now includes 16GB of RAM, double the amount of the previous entry-level configuration, with an option for up to 32GB. For the M4 iMac models with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, all four of the USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4 transfer speeds of up to 40Gb/s. The prior-generation M3 iMac with four ports had two Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB-3 ports. The 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU models only have two ports, but both of those are Thunderbolt 4. All of the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports also support USB 4 and USB 3.1 Gen 2.
<br/>

<br/>
Key features of the new iMac include:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
    <li>New 12MP front camera with Center Stage and Desk View support.</li>
<br/>
    <li>New color options including green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Optional nano-texture display for further reduced glare (+$200).</li>
<br/>
    <li>Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on higher-end models (up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports).</li>
<br/>
    <li>Support for up to an 8K external display at 60Hz with M4 chip with 10-core CPU/GPU.</li>
<br/>
</ul>The updated iMac is available to order now. Pricing starts at $1,299 for the 8-core CPU/GPU version, while the 10-core CPU/GPU models with four ports are priced starting at $1,499. The first orders will arrive to customers and in-store availability will begin on Friday, November 8.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New Mac mini</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Tuesday introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">completely redesigned Mac mini models</a> featuring the company's latest M4 and M4 Pro chips. The new Mac mini boasts a dramatically smaller footprint, enhanced connectivity, and significant performance gains over the previous generation.
<br/>

<br/>
<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-mini-Glowing-Blue-and-Purple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-973629\" />
<br/>
The new machine's enclosure measures just five inches square, thanks to a new thermal architecture that guides air through the device's foot to efficiently cool the system. As part of the redesign, Apple has relocated the power button to the bottom of the enclosure. 
<br/>

<br/>
Here are the standout features of the redesigned Mac mini:
<br/>

<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
    <li>M4 chip with up to 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, or M4 Pro chip with up to 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Up to 64GB memory on M4 Pro model, with 16GB now standard on base M4 model.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Two USB-C ports on the front and three Thunderbolt 5 ports on the back (M4 Pro model). The M4 model continues to have Thunderbolt 4 ports.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Up to 2x faster GPU performance than M1 model with M4 Pro.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Apple's first carbon-neutral Mac.</li>
<br/>
</ul>The base model with M4 chip starts at just $599, making it Apple's most affordable Mac. Pre-orders for the new Mac mini are open now, with availability beginning Friday, November 8.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New MacBook Pro</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/\">announced</a> new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models featuring M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, alongside a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip/\">entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> powered by the M4 chip.

<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, and is up to 1.8x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 for tasks like editing gigapixel photos, while more demanding workloads like rendering complex scenes in Blender are up to 3.4x faster, according to Apple. It also features up to 24 hours of battery life, the longest ever in a Mac.
<br/>

<br/>
Key enhancements in the new base model M4 MacBook Pro include:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
    <li>16GB of unified memory now standard, doubling the previous base configuration.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Three Thunderbolt 4 ports, up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports in the predecessor.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Support for up to two 6K external displays, even with the laptop lid open.</li>

<br/>
Below, we've compiled a recap of all the highlights.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New iMac</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Monday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">announced</a> its latest 24-inch iMac, bringing the M4 chip to the all-in-one desktop computer.

<br/>
The base model now includes 16GB of RAM, double the amount of the previous entry-level configuration, with an option for up to 32GB. For the M4 iMac models with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, all four of the USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4 transfer speeds of up to 40Gb/s. The prior-generation M3 iMac with four ports had two Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB-3 ports. The 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU models only have two ports, but both of those are Thunderbolt 4. All of the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports also support USB 4 and USB 3.1 Gen 2.
<br/>

<br/>
Key features of the new iMac include:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
    <li>New 12MP front camera with Center Stage and Desk View support.</li>
<br/>
    <li>New color options including green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Optional nano-texture display for further reduced glare (+&#36;200).</li>
<br/>
    <li>Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on higher-end models (up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports).</li>
<br/>
    <li>Support for up to an 8K external display at 60Hz with M4 chip with 10-core CPU/GPU.</li>
<br/>
</ul>The updated iMac is available to order now. Pricing starts at &#36;1,299 for the 8-core CPU/GPU version, while the 10-core CPU/GPU models with four ports are priced starting at &#36;1,499. The first orders will arrive to customers and in-store availability will begin on Friday, November 8.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New Mac mini</h2>
<br/>
Apple on Tuesday introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">completely redesigned Mac mini models</a> featuring the company's latest M4 and M4 Pro chips.

<br/>
The new machine's enclosure measures just five inches square, thanks to a new thermal architecture that guides air through the device's foot to efficiently cool the system. As part of the redesign, Apple has relocated the power button to the bottom of the enclosure.

<br/>
    <li>Two USB-C ports on the front and three Thunderbolt 5 ports on the back (M4 Pro model). The M4 model continues to have Thunderbolt 4 ports.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Up to 2x faster GPU performance than M1 model with M4 Pro.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Apple's first carbon-neutral Mac.</li>
<br/>
</ul>The base model with M4 chip starts at just &#36;599, making it Apple's most affordable Mac. Pre-orders for the new Mac mini are open now, with availability beginning Friday, November 8.

First introduced with the Pro Display XDR in 2019, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.

Earlier this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/nano-texture-display-returns-to-imac/\">reintroduced</a> the nano-texture display option to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>'s nano-texture glass is a build-to-order option that costs $150, configurable at the point of purchase.

First introduced with the Pro Display XDR in 2019, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.

Apple:<blockquote>MacBook Air is the world's most popular laptop, and with Apple Intelligence, it's even better.

Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said:<blockquote>Apple silicon has taken the Mac to unprecedented heights, and the rapid pace of innovation continues with M4 Pro and M4 Max. With the world's fastest CPU core, immensely more powerful GPUs, and the fastest Neural Engine ever, the power-efficient performance and capabilities of the M4 family extend its lead as the most advanced lineup of chips in the industry.</blockquote>The M4 Max's 16-core CPU contains 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores, making it 2.2x faster than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a>. The GPU contains up to 40 cores for performance up to 1.9x faster than the &zwnj;M1 Max&zwnj;. The M4 Max supports up to 128GB of unified memory with up to 546GB/s of memory bandwidth. The chip also contains an enhanced Media Engine with two video encode engines and two ProRes accelerators. Like the M4 Pro chip, the M4 Max supports Thunderbolt 5 with up to 120Gb/s data transfer capability.

<br/>
In the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, the M4 chip is available with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, and it has a 16-core Neural Engine for Apple Intelligence. For the 10-core CPU, there are four performance cores and six efficiency cores. Memory bandwidth has increased to 120 GB/s for this model, up from 100 GB/s previously.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/\">introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro</a> earlier this year, and in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">the new iMac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> models this week. Geekbench 6 benchmark results showed the M4 chip is up to 25% faster than the M3 chip in the iPad Pro, and performance improvements should be similar for Macs with the M4 chip compared to previous models with the M3 chip.
<br/>

<br/>
Just like the new iMac, the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, compared to 8GB for previous models. The base model is now available with up to 32GB of RAM, up from the previous 24GB limit.
<br/>

<br/>
Storage capacity options remain 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB.
<br/>

<br/>
The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro is now equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the previous model has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The laptop now supports up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution, even when the lid is open.
<br/>

<br/>
The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro can now be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. And the base model's display brightness has also increased from 600 nits to 1,000 nits for standard non-HDR content in outdoor environments, according to Apple's tech specs.
<br/>

<br/>
The base model also gets an upgraded 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage support to keep you centered in the frame, and a Desk View feature can show others your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple says the MacBook Pro now offers up to 24 hours of battery life for \"video streaming,\" the \"longest ever in a Mac.\"

<br/>

<br/>
<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466\" />
<br/>
In the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, the M4 chip is available with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, and it has a 16-core Neural Engine for Apple Intelligence. For the 10-core CPU, there are four performance cores and six efficiency cores. Memory bandwidth has increased to 120 GB/s for this model, up from 100 GB/s previously.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/\">introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro</a> earlier this year, and in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">the new iMac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> models this week. Geekbench 6 benchmark results showed the M4 chip is up to 25% faster than the M3 chip in the iPad Pro, and performance improvements should be similar for Macs with the M4 chip compared to previous models with the M3 chip.
<br/>

<br/>
Just like the new iMac, the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, compared to 8GB for previous models. The base model is now available with up to 32GB of RAM, up from the previous 24GB limit.
<br/>

<br/>
Storage capacity options remain 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB.
<br/>

<br/>
The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro is now equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the previous model has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The laptop now supports up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution, even when the lid is open.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro can now be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. And the base model's display brightness has also increased from 600 nits to 1,000 nits for standard non-HDR content in outdoor environments, according to Apple's tech specs.
<br/>

<br/>
The base model also gets an upgraded 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage support to keep you centered in the frame, and a Desk View feature can show others your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple says the MacBook Pro now offers up to 24 hours of battery life for \"video streaming,\" the \"longest ever in a Mac.\"

<br/>
Apple has made the darker Space Black finish available for the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro this year, alongside Silver. Space Black was previously exclusive to 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models configured with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips.
<br/>

<br/>
The base model 14-inch MacBook Pro has no major external design changes, and some specs are the same as the previous model, such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. In addition to three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port and an SD card slot remain.

There are now two desktop Macs and four Apple silicon chip options for users who do not need the expandability of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; starts at $1,999, overshadowing the $599 starting price of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a> and even the $1,399 starting price of the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, so do you need the performance of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, or is the humble &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; sufficient for your needs? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two desktop Macs is best for you.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; share some fundamental features, including a familiar, boxy silver aluminum design, two front-facing USB-C ports along with HDMI and ethernet on the rear, and Apple silicon chipsets. That being said, the two machines have much more in contrast than they do in common, including different chip options, memory capacities, ports, and external display support capabilities.

To some extent, purchasing decisions should be driven by budget, but it is worth bearing in mind that any savings on the desktop computer itself can be put toward a good external display such as Apple's Studio Display, which starts from $1,599. For example, an M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; paired with a Studio Display comes to $2,898, which is just $899 more than a lone base model &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and $1,101 less than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with no display.
<br/>

<br/>
You should only consider the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; if you have a professional workflow that can leverage the extreme power of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra, as well as its additional ports and memory options. If you need the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, you will likely know that you are looking for a highly powerful machine that is capable of supporting specific intense workflows. Most customers should choose the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, saving $700 when looking at the base models. There will likely still be substantial savings when it comes to custom configurations.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is also a better choice for most users at the current time since its chip technology is two generations ahead of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, offering higher clock speeds, much faster single-core performance, a redesigned GPU architecture, AV1 decode, a markedly more powerful Neural Engine, and more.

There are now two desktop Macs and four Apple silicon chip options for users who do not need the expandability of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,999, overshadowing the &#36;599 starting price of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a> and even the &#36;1,399 starting price of the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, so do you need the performance of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, or is the humble &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; sufficient for your needs? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two desktop Macs is best for you.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; share some fundamental features, including a familiar, boxy silver aluminum design, two front-facing USB-C ports along with HDMI and ethernet on the rear, and Apple silicon chipsets. That being said, the two machines have much more in contrast than they do in common, including different chip options, memory capacities, ports, and external display support capabilities.

Following the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;'s redesign this year, the dimensions of the two devices are now radically different, with the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; dwarfing the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; in every way.

To some extent, purchasing decisions should be driven by budget, but it is worth bearing in mind that any savings on the desktop computer itself can be put toward a good external display such as Apple's Studio Display, which starts from &#36;1,599. For example, an M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; paired with a Studio Display comes to &#36;2,898, which is just &#36;899 more than a lone base model &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &#36;1,101 less than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with no display.
<br/>

<br/>
You should only consider the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; if you have a professional workflow that can leverage the extreme power of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra, as well as its additional ports and memory options. If you need the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, you will likely know that you are looking for a highly powerful machine that is capable of supporting specific intense workflows. Most customers should choose the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, saving &#36;700 when looking at the base models. There will likely still be substantial savings when it comes to custom configurations.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is also a better choice for most users at the current time since its chip technology is two generations ahead of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, offering higher clock speeds, much faster single-core performance, a redesigned GPU architecture, AV1 decode, a markedly more powerful Neural Engine, and more. As a result, those looking to buy an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; may be better served by the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;. Those who can take advantage of the performance of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; may still be better off with that high-end machine.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/\">M4 Macs</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio/\">Mac Mini vs. Mac Studio Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2337590/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"))) ("Apple Expected to Unveil New MacBook Pros Today With These Features" "Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/\">promised three Mac-related product announcements this week</a>, and it has delivered on two of them so far with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">the new iMac on Monday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">the redesigned Mac mini on Tuesday</a>.
